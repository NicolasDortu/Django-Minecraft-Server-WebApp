# Django Minecraft Server WebApp
This is the basic WebApp I made for my Minecraft server (I use PythonAnywhere as a host). <br>
The WebApp allows users to download the customized launcher to join the modded server and also to join the Discord channel. There is also a link to the dynamic map of the server.
