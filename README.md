# Django Minecraft Server WebApp
This is the basic WebApp I made for my Minecraft server (I use PythonAnywhere as a host). <br>
The WebApp allows users to download the customized launcher installer to join the modded server and also to join the Discord channel. There is also a link to the dynamic map of the server. <br>
It also serves as a storage and an API to : <br>
<ul>
<li>Download the mods list required to join the server</li> 
<li>The custom mods that aren't on Forge</li>
<li>The current version of the launcher which proposes an update to the user in case the version is higher than the one currently in use by the user</li>
<li>The update .exe file is stored in the update folder</li>
</ul><br>
